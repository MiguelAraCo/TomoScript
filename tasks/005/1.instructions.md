        The function signature should be:

        ```typescript
        const evaluateStudent = (student: Student): boolean => {
          // Body
        };
        ```

        </details>

   2. Calculates the average test score and returns `true` if the student passed (the average score is higher or equal to 6) or
      `false` if it didn't

   You should reuse the function `getAverage` that you created in the previous task

2. Write a function called `evaluateStudents` that does the following:

   1. Receives an array of students that have the properties described by interface `Student`

        The function signature should be:

        ```typescript
        const evaluateStudents = (
          students: Array<Student>
        ): {
          passed: Array<Student>;
          failed: Array<Student>;
        } => {
          // Body
        };
        ```

        </details>

   2. Returns an object with the following properties:

      1. `passed`: with the array of students that had an average test score higher or equal than 6
      2. `failed`: with the array of students that had an average test score lower than 6
