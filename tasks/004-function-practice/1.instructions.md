  2. Returns the average score
2. Create a function called `getMaximum` that does the following:
  1. Receives an array of scores
  2. Returns the maximum score
3. Create a function called `getMinimum` that does the following:
  1. Receives an array of scores

     To calculate the median:

    1. Reorder the array of scores from the lowest to the largest (search JavaScript how to sort an array)
    2. Return the value that is in the middle of the sorted array (the reordered array)

5. Create a function called `getStatistics` that does the following:

  1. Receives an array of scores
  2. Returns an object with the following properties:
    1. `average`
    2. `maximum`
    3. `minimum`
    4. `median`

   This function should use the other functions to calculate each value and then add them to a `results` object
